## Faculty Questions

- The clustering algorithm you used divides a video into three second chunks and places viewports whose centers are less than Ï€/5 apart for 60% of a chunk into the same cluster. What was the motivation behind using these particular parameters for clustering? Did you encounter problems with different parameters? (Trying to gain insight into clustering methodology)
- You focused on three components of user QoE (quality of experience) when investigating adaptive video streaming: average video quality, duration and frequency of rebufferings, and number and frequency of quality switches. Do you have any insights as to the degree to which these individual components contribute to the overall QoE? (For example, video stutter due to rebuffering is likely very noticeable and has a high impact on QoE. But a decrease in video quality (within a certain threshold) may not be so noticeable, especially if a user is moving their head around quickly.)
