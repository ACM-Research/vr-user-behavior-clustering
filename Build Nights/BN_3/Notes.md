# Build Night 3

## Potential Ideas

- Using cartography to find accurate storage statistic
- How big should the angle of the clusters be (why pi/5 in the Taxonomy paper?)
- How to compare results with existing methods (linear regression, other ML models)
- Maybe use a cube map (or Dymaxian map) instead of a 2d projection?
- k means clustering
