# Build Night 5

## Geodesic distance team

### Testing values from library

* Test values for a few test cases
* Test results (check if resulting adjacency matrix has correct edges, ie. map the geodesic distance onto the 2D projection and see if edges between users should be there or not)

## BK Algorithm Team

### Help Geodesic testing in order to check clustering

* Clustering can't be fully validated until adjacency matrix is confirmed
* Work to help test and validate adjacency matrix created by geodesic distance threshold, then check if resulting clusters make sense
* Possible ideas on visualizing these clusters?

## Next steps

### Visualizing Clusters

* Important for determining relative accuracy of algorithm
* Slight changes to Data Parser to save Users in a way that allows us to map nodes in clusters to user viewport centers
* Map graph onto image to visualize

### Classifying users for the whole video using the clusters per frame

* Speak with Dr. Prakash in order to validate and develop ideas on user classification given the clusters
* What parameters can be tuned?

## Papers

* Clustering Approach 360 degree video streaming (Through Section 3)

## Faculty meeting

* Will be sending when2meet soon, keep an eye out for slack
